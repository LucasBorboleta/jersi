# TODO
The next tasks are as follows:

- [ ] Test session for version 3 of the rules; especially the standard setting.
- [ ] Ideas for rules to be explored (after discussion with Francois Bazenant):
  - [ ] Kamikaze shape: beats any shape and beaten by any shape.
  - [ ] Option for each player to select its special shape: Kamikaze or Guardian.
  - [ ] About replacing one or more regular shapes (cukla, kuctai or kurfa) by special shapes.
- [ ] Write a script for a YouTube video that is short and clear (more than existing video-rule).
- [ ] Propose material to be downloaded for crafting the board.
