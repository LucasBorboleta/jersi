# TODO
Next major tasks:

- [ ] Implement JERSI 4.0 on Tabletopia virtual plateform.

- [ ] Enroll people in testing sessions.

- [ ] Create social event.

- [ ] ##### Record the feedback of Tyler: add rules that incite to protect the kunti; idea: when your opponent capture your kunti, he/she resets it at a position of his/her choice in your first row, but in addition (this is a new rule) you have to "pay" be giving him/her a piece of your choice (my son Cr suggests that the given piece is chosen from your reserve only i.e. a mountain or a transport/carrier).

Maybe/later tasks:

- [ ] Write a script for a YouTube video that is short and clear (more than existing video-rule).
- [ ] Propose material to be downloaded for hand-crafting the board.
