# TODO
Next major tasks:

- [ ] Give more power to the wise man; but only a defensive power:
  - [ ] Only the foul can capture the wise. Cons: the wise would become too much powerful.
  - [ ] The foul cannot capture the wise, only rock/paper/scissors can.
  - [ ] The wise can move mountain of the same color. Cons: it creates an exception in the rules. So is it useful?
- [ ] Enroll more people in testing sessions.
- [ ] Get more feedback on the text of the rules.
- [ ] Try new icons for the cubes.

Maybe/later tasks:

- [ ] Make a YouTube video that explains the rules.
- [ ] Create social event like a tournament.
