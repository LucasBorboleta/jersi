# TODO
The next tasks are as follows:

- [ ] Implement the game on Tabletopia web platform.
- [ ] Test JERSI version 3 by introducing the new shape **mokca**, 1 or 2 occurrences in each color, that acts as a **defender**:

  * no other shape can beat **mokca**; **mokca** cannot beat any other shape;
  * no stack of height 2 can move to a cell neighboring a **mokca** shape; only stack of height 1 can;
  * **mokca** can be inside a stack of height 2, either on its top or bottom;
  * **mokca** means *geometrical point* in Lojban, and it refers to its representation in JERSI as a single dot on each face of a die;
  * **mokca** is pronounced */ˈmokʃa/* in Lojban.
- [ ] Find a new setting notation: sort names lexicographically; select the first consonant if not conflicting yet, otherwise try the next consonant; 
  * cukla : C
  * kuctai : K
  * kunti : N
  * kurfa : R
  * mokca : M
- [ ] Write a script for a YouTube video that is short and clear (more than existing video-rule).
- [ ] Propose material to be downloaded for crafting the board.
