# JERSI



**Jersi** describes the rules of a **strategy game** for two players:

> The two Jersi players embody two armies of cubes fighting on a game board. Each player must bring his king cube to the opposite edge of the board and thus win the war. At the start, on the board, alongside the king, each player has warrior cubes with emblems of rock, paper, scissors and also foul warriors. Then, from his reserve, each player can parachute mountain or wise men cubes.
>
> Each type of cube has a unique capacity. Thus, the king does not fight, but does not die: after his capture, he is sent back to his starting line. Cubes can be stacked for faster movement or to protect a threatened cube, indeed the power of a stack resides in the cube at its top. Cubes and stacks can fight each other.
>
> On his turn, the player performs simple or combined actions such as building a stack and moving it or moving a stack and unbuilding it: beware of accelerations and double captures!
> Juggle the stacks and take advantage of the rock-paper-scissor cycle!
