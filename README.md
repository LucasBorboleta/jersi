# JERSI



**Jersi** describes the rules of an **abstract game** for two players:

> Your white shapes chase after your opponent's black in order to capture their unique black “**kunti**”, and vice versa. On the hexagonal board, stacks project your forces and protect your forms from enemy threats. But not completely, because a ternary and cyclical order governs the forces. So, you will have to stack and unstack your shapes at the right time and in the right place!

Unless you are interested in the latest rules being under construction, it is better to read the released versions either in directory [**releases**](./releases) or at GitHub URL [**releases**](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/jersi/releases).
