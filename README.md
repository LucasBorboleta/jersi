JERSI describes the rules of a **strategy game** for two players:

> With the wise men of the Jersi universe you will cross mountains, but beware of fools! In this chess game where rock, paper and scissors fight each other, the goal is for your king to cross the field. You move each cubic piece either individually or by stacking it on top of another which then acts as a quick mount.
