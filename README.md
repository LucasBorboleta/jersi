# JERSI



**Jersi** describes the rules of an **abstract game** for two players:

> The players embody two armies of cubes which compete on a game board. Each player must bring his king to the opposite edge of the board and thus win the war. The cubes move on the board or are parachuted from the players' reserves. Piles of cubes move faster and attack from a greater distance than cubes alone. Beware of accelerations!

Unless you are interested in the latest rules being under construction, it is better to read the released versions either in directory [**releases**](./releases) or at GitHub URL [**releases**](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/jersi/releases).
