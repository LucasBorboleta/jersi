**Jersi** describes the rules of an **abstract game** for two players: blue and red. Hereafter is an overview. See the rules for details.

On a **hexagonal board**, each player moves his/her colored pieces, called forms: 1 **kunti**, 4 **cukla**, 4 **kurfa** and 4 **kuctai**. The goal is to capture the opponent **kunti**. Forms can be stacked up to a height of two? Forms can also be unstacked. The height of the stack governs the move length. The form at the top governs the force of the moved form/stack. During a turn, each player plays one or two moves. There are constraints on the second optional move. 

**Kunti** is the weakest form, but there are no strongest from amongst **cukla**, **kurfa** and **kuctai**. So the aim of the game is use space and time for **breaking** such a **symmetry**.
