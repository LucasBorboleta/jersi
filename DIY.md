2. [Method 1](#Method-1)
3. [Method 2](#Method-2)

## Tips
- Recommended cube size : either 2 cm or 1.6 cm.
- Recommended cell size on the board : 2 times the cube size.
- If the next methods do not match your needs then you could try to reuse pictures and drawings (vectorial or not) from the following [file tree](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/jersi/tree/main/pictures/diy).

## Method 1
- Making the cubes:
  - Buy wooden painted cubes of 2 cm size : 21 whites and 21 blacks.
  - Using "strong paper" ("cartonnette" in French) print the A4 page [cubes](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/jersi/blob/main/pictures/diy/cubes.pdf), cut its shapes and glue them on each face of the wooden cubes.

- Making the board:
  - Buy a wooden board of size 40 cm x 36 cm (left-to-right x front-back).
  - Print the hexagon template of 4 cm width from the A4 page [hexagon-template-2cm](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/jersi/blob/main/pictures/diy/hexagon-template-2cm.pdf) and used it together with a ruler to draw the board.
  - Paint the hexagons of the board using colored varnishes.


## Method 2
- Making the cubes:
  - Instead of gluing shapes of cube faces, as in [Method 1](#Method-1), draw the shapes using a felt pen with the help of a drawing template ruler.
  - Since white felt pen is merely "white paint pen" which tends to get erased, an alternate option is to
    replace black cubes by red cubes and to mark their faces using a black felt pen.
- Making the board:
  - Instead of drawing and painted the hexagons, as in [Method 1](#Method-1), print the A3 page [jersi_board_a3_wor_2c](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/jersi/blob/main/pictures/diy/boards/jersi_board_a3_wor_2c.pdf)
  - Glue the printed A3 page (after cutting some edges) to a wooden board of size 32cm x 29cm (left-to-right x front-back).
